# Multi-Task-Transformer-with-Drug-Specific-Attention-for-HIV-1-Protease-Inhibitor-Resistance
A transformer-based deep learning framework that processes  complete HIV-1 protease sequences (99 amino acids) to predict resistance to  eight protease inhibitors. Our model incorporates positional encoding and  drug-specific attention mechanisms to identify mutation patterns associated  with resistance.
